# Assignment 1: Python fundamentals

## Instructions

You may work independently or with **1** other partner. If you work with a partner, you should work together on all parts rather than splitting up the work. If you *really, really* want to work with a group of 3, let Matt know and we can discuss more.

The Jupyter Notebook [assignment_1.ipynb](assignment_1.ipynb) contains the questions. Each question is worth 10 points. For each question I will be looking for:
*	Correct answer (3 points)
*	Logical, organized code (2 points)
*	Comments within your code (2 points)
*	Writing a doc string for your function(s) (1 point)
*	Writing tests that demonstrate that the code works as intended (2 points)


**To turn submit your work** you may do one of the following
* In Canvas, submit the link to your Jupyter notebook in GitHub (preferred method, *1 point extra credit*)
* In Canvas, submit the path to the notebook on HiPerGator
* In Canvas, upload the .ipynb file

*A note for people who have taken Matt's Computational Tools for Research in Biology Class*: Unlike in that class, I will **not** be looking to see that each group member has made a commit in the GitHub repo. You should work together, but it is fine to use one person's version to submit your answers. You do not need to manage branching, mergining etc. Of course, if you want to, but not needed on this assignment.
