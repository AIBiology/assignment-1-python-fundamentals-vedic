    "Write a Python function to find the roots of a quadratic equation, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. (The easiest way to do this is by using the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula) that you learned in algebra: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.)  Your function should take three arguments that represent the  coefficients of the equation to solve (e.g., `find_roots(a, b, c)`). If there are no real roots (i.e., if complex numbers would be required), your function can simply return `None`. You will need to use Python's [math package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) to solve this problem.\n",
